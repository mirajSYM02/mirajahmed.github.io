        (a) Emergency responses to the rescue.</br>
        (b) Mobile app provides the notification of incident.</br>
        (c) Mobile app shows the location of the incident.</br>

        <p>
          This project's primary objective is to reduce traffic fatalities. If response time is shortened, fatalities
          will eventually decrease. Thus, the project's sole significance is reflected in its name, which is alert and
          notification.

        <h3>Hardware Description</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="image left"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span>The NodeMCU is implemented on WI-FI which
          is why the first and foremost job is to provide connection to the controller. As soon as the controller
          receives the connection the GPS sensor starts looking for satellite, through which the GPS sensor will
          determine the incident location.
          The alert is generated entirely within the device; no external application is required. When the ultrasonic
          sensor detects a certain distance between the rider car and the car ahead or any obstacle ahead, the sensor
          activates the buzzer, which begins emitting sounds to alert the driver. The driver can disable the alert by
          switching it off or simply increasing the distance between the cars or the obstacle.
          While the GPS sensor generates location data via satellite, the real hero behind the curtain is the 3-axis
          accelerometer. The accelerometer continuously records the values of the XYZ axis. The threshold value for each
          axis is determined by calculating the three-axis value of the UTM road. Following that, the application
          receives the location via a push notification, which the user can view.

        <h3>Software Description</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="image right"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="" /></span>In the mobile android application the
          location is displayed on the map coordinates. However, notification will be the first one to be carried to the
          application before the location can be seen. The process is shown in figure 4, where the snaps from the left
          is considered as the first to start then carry on until the very right of the figure. On the first snap the
          application is on the homepage before the arrival of notification. Later snap depicts the arrival of the
          notification which carries the coordinates of the location. After pressing upon the notification, the later
          snap will be visible on the application and it will provide the accident location details as well as a
          pointer.
