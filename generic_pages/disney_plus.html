					<h3>Movies and Shows Dashboard </h3>
					<p>The dashboard highlights some details about selective movies as well some general information about the
						platform.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<strong>Details:</strong> In this case study, I had to analyze the factors contributing to the high viewership
					of Disney+ shows and movies.
				</p>

				<div class="image project"><img src="/images/disneyplusDashboard.jpg" alt="Disney+ Dashboard" /></div>
				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Action:</strong> The following data was analyzed:
				<ul>
					<li>Shows and movies ratings</li>
					<li>Description about shows or movies</li>
					<li>Ratings on different genres</li>
					<li>Number of views</li>
					<li>Demographics of viewers</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Results:</strong> Based on the analysis, the following insights were found:
				<ul>
					<li>The top shows and movies have ratings of Rated G and PG.</li>
					<li>The top genres are Animation, Comedy, and Family.</li>
					<li>Most shows are based in the USA.</li>
					<li>The platform has more movies than TV shows.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The insights suggest that the high viewership of Disney+ shows and movies is due
					to the company's strong library of content, its focus on family-friendly programming, and its affordable
					pricing. Disney+ is well-positioned to continue its success as a popular streaming service.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Recommendations:</strong> Here are some additional recommendations for Disney+:
				<ul>
					<li>Continue to invest in original content.</li>
					<li>Expand the library of family-friendly programming.</li>
					<li>Keep pricing affordable.</li>
					<li>Promote Disney+ as a great way to watch favorite Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic
						movies and shows.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, the Disney+ dashboard is a valuable tool for Disney+ executives. It provides insights into the
					viewership of their shows and movies and can help them make decisions about future programming.
