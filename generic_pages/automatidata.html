          <h2>Regression Analysis</h2>
          <h3>Simplifying Complex Data Relationships and Predicting Taxi Fares</h3>

        </header>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>In the world of data analysis and predictive modeling, regression analysis plays a vital role in uncovering
          relationships between variables. In this blog post, we delve into a fascinating project undertaken by the
          Automatidata team for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC). The goal was to build a
          multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data collected over the course of a
          year. Let's explore the key insights and findings from this project, showcasing the power of Exploratory Data
          Analysis (EDA) and regression modeling.</p>
        <h3>Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Checking Model Assumptions</h3>
        <strong>EDA Purpose:</strong>
        <p>EDA serves several purposes before constructing a multiple linear regression model. It helps us understand
          the data, detect correlations, identify outliers, missing data, and duplicates. By conducting thorough EDA, we
          gain crucial insights into the dataset's characteristics and make informed decisions about feature selection.
        </p>
        <strong>Key EDA Steps:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Box plots were utilized to visualize and identify outliers in significant columns such as trip_distance,
            fare_amount, and duration.</li>
          <li>Outliers were handled by imputing lower values below $0 to 0 and capping maximum values using the 75th
            percentile (Q3) plus six times the interquartile range (IQR).</li>
          <li>Feature engineering techniques were applied to create additional variables, including mean_distance,
            mean_duration, pickup_dropoff, day, month, and rush_hour.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation</h3>
        <strong>Resources Utilized:</strong>
        <p>During the model building and evaluation stage, several resources and techniques were employed to ensure
          accurate predictions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing was used to normalize the data.</li>
          <li>The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with the test set accounting for 20% of the samples.
          </li>
          <li>LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model was instantiated and fit to the training data.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Model Evaluation:</strong>
        <p>The multiple linear regression model yielded impressive results, as indicated by the following metrics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coefficient of determination (R^2): 0.8398</li>
          <li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.187</li>
          <li>Mean Squared Error (MSE): 17.890</li>
          <li>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 4.230</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>Part 3: Interpreting Model Results</h3>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Mean_distance was identified as the feature with the greatest impact on predicting fare amounts, with an
            average increase of $7 per mile traveled.</li>
          <li>The scatterplot of actual versus predicted values visually demonstrated the model's accuracy and ability
            to capture fare patterns.</li>
          <li>The histogram of residuals showcased a normal distribution around zero, indicating that the model's errors
            were evenly distributed and unbiased.</li>
          <li>The correlation matrix and heatmap revealed a strong correlation between mean_duration, mean_distance, and
            the target variable, fare_amount.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="image project"><img src="/images/actual_vs_predicted.png" alt="Prediction" /></div>
        <br>
        <strong>Business Recommendations:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider adjusting fare rates based on distance traveled, with a focus on optimizing revenue by aligning
            with passenger preferences.</li>
          <li>Leverage the mean_duration variable to estimate trip durations accurately and provide customers with more
            reliable time estimates.</li>
          <li>Explore the impact of rush_hour trips on fare amounts, potentially offering differentiated pricing or
            incentives during peak hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>The project successfully demonstrated the power of EDA and multiple linear regression in predicting taxi
          fares based on historical data. By understanding the data, creating meaningful features, and building an
          accurate model, valuable insights were obtained for the NYC TLC. This information can drive data-driven
          decision-making, optimize fare pricing strategies, and enhance the overall taxi experience. Regression
          analysis continues to be an essential tool in simplifying complex data relationships and unlocking predictive
          capabilities across various industries.</p>
