					<h3>Top 250 Highest Rated Movies Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
					<p>This page highlights project details about the exploratory data analysis that I conducted on the IMDB top
						250 highest rated movies.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<strong>Situation:</strong> I was interested in exploring and analyzing the top 250 highest rated movies on
					IMDb. I wanted to see what factors contribute to a movie's success, such as genre, director, year of release,
					and runtime.
				</p>

				<div class="image project"><img src="/images/shawshank.jpg" alt="Average Rating" /></div>
				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Task:</strong> I used the Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore and analyze the
					dataset. I looked at the distribution of values in each column and created visualizations to show the
					relationships between different variables.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Actions:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Utilize Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to analyze the IMDB top 250 dataset.</li>
					<li>Examine the distribution of values in each column.</li>
					<li>Create visualizations to illustrate the relationships between variables.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Results:</strong> Here are some of the key findings from my analysis:
				<ul>
					<li>The majority of movies in the dataset have a rating between 8.0 and 9.0, indicating that they are
						generally well-received by audiences.</li>
					<li>The year 1995 had the most number of top movies in the list, followed by 2004 and 1957.</li>
					<li>R and PG-13 are the most common certificate ratings in the top 250 list, suggesting that most of the
						movies are targeted towards mature audiences.</li>
					<li>Christopher Nolan, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese have the most
						movies in the top 250 list, while Hayao Miyazaki has the highest among non-English language directors.</li>
					<li>Longer movies with a duration of 180 minutes are popular among filmmakers, with both classic and modern
						movies in the list, suggesting that audiences are willing to invest their time in movies that offer a rich
						and immersive experience.</li>
					<li>PG-13 is the most common certificate rating for the genre of Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi movies, while
						R-rated movies are common for the genre of Action, Crime, and Drama movies.</li>
					<li>Successful and highly acclaimed directors are not limited to a single genre, and versatility and a
						willingness to experiment with different genres may contribute to a director's success.</li>
					<li>There is a fluctuation in the average rating of movies over the years, with the highest being in the 1970s
						and 1990s and the lowest being in the 1920s and 1930s, but there is no significant difference between the
						average rating of the last decade and the previous decade.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> My analysis of the IMDb Top 250 dataset revealed several interesting findings.
					The majority of movies in the dataset have a rating between 8.0 and 9.0, with most falling within the range of
					slightly good to very good. The year 1995 had the most number of top movies with 8 films making it to the
					list, followed by 2004 and 1957. The most common certificate rating is R, followed by PG and PG-13.
					Christopher Nolan, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese are all tied for the
					top spot with 7 movies each in the IMDb top 250 list. The longest duration for top-rated movies is 180
					minutes, and PG-13 is the most common certificate rating for the genre of Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi
					movies.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> I believe that my analysis is useful for anyone who is interested in learning
					more about the factors that contribute to a movie's success. The findings of my analysis can be used to help
					filmmakers make better movies and to help audiences choose movies that they are more likely to enjoy.
