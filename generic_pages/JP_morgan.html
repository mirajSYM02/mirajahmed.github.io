				<section>
					<header>
						<h4><strong>Task 1: Creating Simple Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel on the Home Loan Dataset</strong>
						</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						<strong>Situation:</strong> The task involves creating a simple data analysis using Microsoft Excel on a
						home loan dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 500 data points that have been cleaned and
						processed to ensure suitability for analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Task:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Utilize Microsoft Excel to perform data analysis on the home loan dataset.</li>
						<li>Generate pivot charts to visualize the data and gain insights.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Actions:</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Clean and process the home loan dataset to prepare it for analysis.</li>
						<li>Utilize pivot charts in Microsoft Excel to create visual representations of the data.</li>
						<li>Analyze the generated charts to derive meaningful insights.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
					<center>
						<div class="image project"><img src="/images/bar chart.png" alt="Dashboard" /></div>
					</center>
					<br>
					<p>
						<strong>Results:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Identified a large number of borrowers with loan-to-value ratios within a specific range, suggesting a
							high demand for mortgages in that range. This presents a potential sales opportunity for lenders to offer
							competitive interest rates and terms, attracting these borrowers.</li>
						<li>Discovered a significant number of borrowers falling within the low-income range. It is recommended that
							lenders consider offering more affordable loan products with lower interest rates and down payments to
							attract this customer segment.</li>
						<li>Observed a higher number of second-time buyers compared to first-time buyers, indicating a potential
							trend in the market.</li>
						<li>Determined that home values appear to be normally distributed, with an average value of approximately
							$430K.</li>
					</ul>
