					<h3>Top 200 Charted Songs Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
					<p>This page highlights project details about the exploratory data analysis that I conducted on the Spotify
						top 200 charted songs</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<strong>Situation:</strong> The task involved exploring and analyzing the Spotify Top 200 Charts dataset to
					identify factors contributing to a song's success. The focus was on understanding trends related to the
					artist, release timing, and genre.
				</p>

				<div class="image project"><img src="/images/song success time.png" alt="Song Success Over Time" /></div>
				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Task:</strong> Utilize Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) to analyze the Spotify Top 200
					Charts dataset and create visualizations to understand the relationships between different variables.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Actions:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to explore and analyze the dataset.</li>
					<li>Examined the distribution of values in each column and created visualizations to identify trends and
						relationships.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>



				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Key Findings:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Taylor Swift had the most successful song in the dataset, based on peak streams, peak position, and days
						since release. Her song "Shake It Off" had a peak of 12.9 million streams and stayed in the top 10 for 11
						weeks.</li>
					<li>The most popular song in the dataset, based on peak position and the number of times in the top 10, was
						"Rockstar" by Post Malone. It had a peak of 11.6 million streams and stayed in the top 10 for 14 weeks.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<div class="image project"><img src="/images/peak stream.png" alt="Peak Streams" /></div>

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						There was a slight positive correlation between a song's success and the length of time it had been
						available on the platform, suggesting that newer songs tend to perform slightly better than older ones.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						However, there were exceptions to this trend, such as "Shallow" by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, which was
						released in 2018 and had a peak of 10.3 million streams.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Certain songs had a significant number of streams during their peak position, even if they were not in the
						top 10 for an extended period. "Shallow" by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper was one such example, indicating
						that
						certain songs can have breakout moments despite not being long-term chart-toppers.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The optimal length for a song to stay in the top 10, in order to maximize the number of peak streams,
						appeared to be around 11-12 weeks. This suggests that listeners are more likely to discover and listen to a
						new song if it is in the top 10, and they are more likely to continue listening to it if it has been in the
						top 10 for a while.
					</li>
				</ul>


				<p>
					<strong>Results:</strong> The analysis of the Spotify Top 200 Charts dataset revealed key insights into the
					factors contributing to a song's success, including artist performance, song popularity, release timing, and
					the optimal length of time in the top 10.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The findings from this analysis can be valuable for artists and music companies
					seeking to understand the dynamics of successful songs on Spotify. By leveraging these insights, they can make
					more informed decisions regarding song releases and promotional strategies.
