					<h2>Data Analytics Capstone</h2>
					<h3>How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?</h3>
					<p>This is one of the capstone projects from the "Google Data Analytics Specialization" course, and it is my
						first time working with Tableau. Hence, the visual might not look appealing, but it does the job to showcase
						the insights.</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<strong>Details:</strong> In this case study, I had to be a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, a bike-share
					company operating in Chicago. The company has a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles and 692 stations across the
					city. The bikes can be rented from one station and returned to any other station within the system.
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Task:</strong> To complete the task, I kept three key questions in mind:
				<ol>
					<li>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</li>
					<li>Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?</li>
					<li>How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Action:</strong> I started by downloading and reviewing the data files, ensuring that the data was
					clean and processed properly for analysis. Then, following the case study guidelines, I performed data
					analysis using spreadsheets. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the data, I created a dashboard using
					Tableau, which allowed for better visualization and sharing of insights.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Results:</strong> Based on the analysis, here are the key insights:
				<ul>
					<li>The most popular spot for both casual riders and annual members to start their bike rides is Streeter Dr
						and Grand Avenue.</li>
					<li>The number of registered members significantly exceeds the number of casual riders, with a difference of
						nearly 500,000.</li>
					<li>Classic bikes are the preferred choice for both casual riders and annual members.</li>
					<li>The summer season shows the highest demand for bike rides.</li>
					<li>Casual riders tend to ride more on weekends, while annual members have consistent usage throughout the
						week.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					From these insights, I attempted to answer the following questions:
				<ol>
					<li><strong>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?</strong><br>
						The insight that registered members outnumber casual riders by a significant margin reinforces the
						difference in usage between the two groups. It suggests that annual members have a more frequent and
						consistent utilization of Cyclistic bikes compared to casual riders.</li>
					<li><strong>Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?</strong><br>
						The insight that the most popular spot for both casual riders and annual members to start their bike rides
						is the same indicates that casual riders might find value in the convenience and accessibility of the
						bike-share system. They may realize that purchasing an annual membership offers them the flexibility to
						easily rent and return bikes from various locations, making it a cost-effective option for their regular
						cycling needs.</li>
					<li><strong>How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?</strong><br>
						The insight that summer is the most popular time to ride cycles aligns with the marketing strategy for
						Cyclistic. By utilizing digital media platforms, Cyclistic can target casual riders with targeted
						advertising and promotions during the summer season, highlighting the benefits of becoming an annual member.
						Emphasizing the availability of bikes, popular starting locations, and the overall positive experience
						during this peak period can effectively influence casual riders to consider purchasing annual memberships.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> These insights provide valuable information for Cyclistic to understand the
					behavior and preferences of their customers. By aligning their marketing efforts with the usage patterns and
					preferences identified in the analysis, Cyclistic can tailor their messaging and incentives to encourage
					casual riders to transition into becoming loyal annual members.
