          <h2>Predicting Factors Behind Employee Attrition</h2>
          <h3>Using Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier with XGBoost</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          This is the capstone project from <a
            href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics"
            target="_blank">Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Program on Coursera</a>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In today's fiercely competitive job market, employee attrition has become a major concern for organizations.
          High
          turnover rates can disrupt productivity, strain resources, and impact overall business performance. To address
          this
          critical challenge, I embarked on a data-driven journey to unravel the factors driving employee attrition and
          identify
          potential solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Stakeholder</h3>
        <p>
          Stakeholders for this project include the HR department, management team, and company executives who are
          interested in
          understanding employee turnover and identifying factors contributing to attrition.
        </p>

        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to analyze employee turnover and identify key factors influencing attrition, enabling the company
          to take
          proactive measures for employee retention and improve workforce management.

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to analyze a comprehensive HR dataset and build predictive models to gain
          insights
          into why employees leave the company. By understanding the key drivers of attrition, we aimed to provide
          actionable
          recommendations to reduce turnover and enhance employee retention.

        <br>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          We adopted the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to guide our analysis:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Situation:</h4>
        <p>
          Our dataset comprised various employee attributes, such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of
          projects,
          average monthly hours, tenure, work accidents, promotions, salary, and department. It included both employees
          who had
          left the company and those who had stayed.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Task:</h4>
        <p>
          The primary task was to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between
          variables and
          identify patterns and trends. We also wanted to explore the impact of different factors on employee attrition
          and create
          predictive models to make informed decisions.
        </p>

        <h4>Action:</h4>
        <p>
          During EDA, we discovered that the dataset contained duplicates, which we promptly removed. We renamed columns
          and
          encoded categorical variables to make them suitable for model building. We visualized the data using various
          plots, such
          as box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts, to uncover insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, we applied machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to
          predict employee
          attrition. We optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and evaluated the models using multiple metrics,
          including
          accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. And the results are:
        </p>

        <h4>Comparison of Evaluation Metrics:</h4>
        <strong>Logistic Regression:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Accuracy: 82.51%</li>
          <li>Precision: 46.69%</li>
          <li>Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate): 26.19%</li>
          <li>F1-score: 33.56%</li>
          <li>AUC-ROC: 88.13%</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Random Forest Classifier:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Accuracy: 98.50%</li>
          <li>Precision: 98.05%</li>
          <li>Recall: 92.80%</li>
          <li>F1-score: 95.35%</li>
          <li>AUC-ROC: 98.06%</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
          Our analysis revealed several key insights:
        <ul>
          <li>Employees with low satisfaction levels and low tenure were more likely to leave the company.</li>
          <li>Work accidents did not appear to have a significant impact on attrition.</li>
          <li>Lack of promotions was associated with higher attrition rates.</li>
          <li>Departments sales and technical departments experienced higher attrition.</li>
          <li>Salary levels were also a crucial factor in influencing attrition rates, with employees in the low salary
            bracket
            being more likely to leave.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          In conclusion, our data-driven journey provided invaluable insights into employee attrition. Armed with these
          findings, organizations can take targeted actions to improve employee retention. To reduce attrition,
          companies should
          focus on enhancing employee satisfaction, providing opportunities for growth and promotions, and offering
          competitive
          salary packages.
        </p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the model results, we propose the following recommendations:
        <ol>
          <li>Conduct regular employee satisfaction surveys to identify areas of improvement and address employee
            concerns.</li>
          <li>Implement talent development programs to offer career advancement opportunities and promotions based on
            merit.</li>
          <li>Review and adjust salary scales to ensure competitiveness within the industry and retain top talent.</li>
          <li>Provide support and resources to enhance work-life balance, reducing employee burnout and stress.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          While our models have demonstrated high accuracy and predictability, continuous monitoring and refinement are
          essential
          to ensure their long-term effectiveness. Organizations should regularly update the models with fresh data to
          keep them
          relevant and enhance predictive power.
        </p>

        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the project, we adhered to ethical principles by handling sensitive employee data with utmost
          confidentiality. We ensured data privacy and security to protect the personal information of individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, our data-driven approach has shed light on the complex dynamics of employee attrition. By
          leveraging
          these insights, organizations can build a motivated and engaged workforce, creating a positive work
          environment and
          fostering long-term growth and success. Employee retention is not just a metric; it's an investment in the
          future of any
          organization. Let us take the first step towards building a thriving workplace and redefining the future of
          work.
