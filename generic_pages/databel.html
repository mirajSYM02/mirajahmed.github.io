          <h2>Databel, Customer Churn Analysis on Tableau</h2>
        </header>

        <h3>Situation:</h3>
        <p>In this Tableau case study, I worked with a dataset from a telecom company called Databel. The company had
          a primary focus on reducing customer churn, which was a top priority for their subscription-based business.
          My task was to analyze the churn rates and gain insights into why customers were churning at the rate they
          were. The story that includes four dashboards for several aspects of churning is fully dynamic dashboards.</p>

            target="_blank">Feel free to work with the dashboards.</a></p>

        <h3>Task:</h3>
        <p>Using Tableau, I created several dashboards to analyze the churn rates of Databel, later combined them in a
          story to show depth of insights. The dashboards included calculated fields and various visualizations, such
          as dual-axis graphs and scatter plots. My goal was to understand the reasons behind customer churn and
          identify strategies to reduce it.</p>

        <!-- Dashboard Details -->
        <h3>The Dashboard details:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>"The Overview" Page:</strong> Designed and implemented a dynamic dashboard featuring two
            interactive donut pie charts for slicing and filtering data, a versatile bar plot, and an informative map,
            collectively providing a comprehensive project overview.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Age Brackets and Groups" Page:</strong> Constructed an analytical dashboard presenting detailed
            insights on age groups and demographics through interactive bar plots, enhanced by user-friendly filtering
            options for a deeper understanding.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Payment and Contract Type" Dashboard:</strong> Engineered an insightful dashboard showcasing
            diverse payment methods and contract types, enriched with interactive filters to facilitate in-depth
            exploration and analysis.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>"Data and International Plan" Dashboard:</strong> Conceptualized and executed a multi-faceted
            dashboard utilizing matrix charts and informative cards to effectively communicate insights, complemented
            by a dynamic filter for seamless data exploration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Action:</h3>
        <p>To accomplish this, I utilized Tableau's features and functionalities. I created calculated fields to
          perform necessary calculations and derived meaningful insights from the data. The visualizations included
          dynamic elements achieved through the use of filters and parameters. By exploring the data and applying
          different visualizations, I aimed to uncover patterns and relationships that could explain the churn rates.

        <h3>Result:</h3>
        <p>Through my analysis in Tableau, I gained valuable insights into the churn rates of Databel. I identified
          key factors that contributed to customer churn and discovered potential strategies to reduce it. The
          visualizations in my dashboard effectively communicated these findings, allowing stakeholders to understand
          the reasons behind churn and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.</p>
