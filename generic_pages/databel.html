          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p>The <strong>churn rate</strong> is a critical business metric that measures the loss of
            <strong>subscribers</strong> or <strong>employees</strong> over a specific <strong>time period</strong>. It
            applies to both <strong>subscription-based businesses</strong> and <strong>workforce management</strong>. In
            essence, it represents the opposite of the <strong>growth rate</strong>, as it quantifies
            <strong>customer</strong> or <strong>talent attrition</strong>. To thrive, a company must consistently
            acquire more <strong>subscriptions</strong> or <strong>employees</strong> than it loses.
            <strong>Industry-specific benchmarks</strong> for <strong>churn rates</strong> provide a valuable
            competitive perspective.

        <h3>Task:</h3>
        <p>My goal was to <strong>understand</strong> the <strong>reasons</strong> behind <strong>customer
            churn</strong> and <strong>identify</strong> <strong>strategies</strong> to <strong>reduce</strong> it. The
          <strong>dashboard's main concern</strong> is to <strong>answer</strong> all the <strong>business
            questions</strong> that will <strong>fulfill</strong> the <strong>customer's need</strong>. It provides
          <strong>insights</strong> into <strong>critical aspects</strong> of Databel's operations, helping the
          <strong>company make informed decisions</strong>. Some of the <strong>questions it answers</strong> include:

            <li>What's the churn rate for people on an unlimited plan who consume less than 5 GB of data?</li>
            <li>The churn rate of customers who have an international plan but don't call internationally is sky-high.
              How many customers are part of this group?</li>

            <li>How many customers that churned are on a Month-to-Month contract and pay by Direct Debit?</li>
            <li>What's the churn rate in Alaska (AK) for customers on a Two-Year contract? (Alaska can be found on the
              top left of the map.)</li>
            <li>What's the churn rate (in %) for customers outside a group who have an account length of 12 months or
              less?</li>
            <li>What's the average number of customer service calls for customers who are on a month-to-month contract
              and by direct debit?</li>

        <h3>Result:</h3>
        <p>Through my analysis in Tableau, I gained valuable insights into the churn rates of Databel. I identified
          key factors that contributed to customer churn and discovered potential strategies to reduce it. The
          visualizations in my dashboard effectively communicated these findings, allowing stakeholders to understand
          the reasons behind churn and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.</p>
