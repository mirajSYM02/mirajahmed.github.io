          <h2>Databel, Customer Churn Analysis on Tableau</h2>
          <div class="image project"><img src="/images/datable_dashboard.png" alt="Databel Story" /></div>
        </header>
        <h3>Situation:</h3>
        <p>In this Tableau case study, I worked with a dataset from a telecom company called Databel. The company had a
          primary focus on reducing customer churn, which was a top priority for their subscription-based business. My
          task was to analyze the churn rates and gain insights into why customers were churning at the rate they were.
        </p>
        <h3>Task:</h3>
        <p>Using Tableau, I created several dashboards to analyze the churn rates of Databel, later combined them in a
          story to show depth of insights. The dashboards included calculated fields and various visualizations, such as
          dual-axis graphs and scatter plots. My goal was to understand the reasons behind customer churn and identify
          strategies to reduce it.</p>
        <h3>Action:</h3>
        <p>To accomplish this, I utilized Tableau's features and functionalities. I created calculated fields to perform
          necessary calculations and derived meaningful insights from the data. The visualizations included dynamic
          elements achieved through the use of filters and parameters. By exploring the data and applying different
          visualizations, I aimed to uncover patterns and relationships that could explain the churn rates.</p>
        <h3>Result:</h3>
        <p>Through my analysis in Tableau, I gained valuable insights into the churn rates of Databel. I identified key
          factors that contributed to customer churn and discovered potential strategies to reduce it. The
          visualizations in my dashboard effectively communicated these findings, allowing stakeholders to understand
          the reasons behind churn and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.</p>
