            <h2>Databel, Customer Churn Analysis on Tableau</h2>

          </header>

          <h3>Situation:</h3>
          <p>In this Tableau case study, I worked with a dataset from a telecom company called Databel. The company had
            a primary focus on reducing customer churn, which was a top priority for their subscription-based business.
            My task was to analyze the churn rates and gain insights into why customers were churning at the rate they
            were. The story that includes four dashboards for several aspects of churning, is fully dynamic dashboards,

              target="_blank">Feel free to work with the dashboards.</a>.</p>
          </p>

          <h3>Task:</h3>
          <p>Using Tableau, I created several dashboards to analyze the churn rates of Databel, later combined them in a
            story to show depth of insights. The dashboards included calculated fields and various visualizations, such
            as dual-axis graphs and scatter plots. My goal was to understand the reasons behind customer churn and
            identify strategies to reduce it.</p>

          <h3>Action:</h3>
          <p>To accomplish this, I utilized Tableau's features and functionalities. I created calculated fields to
            perform necessary calculations and derived meaningful insights from the data. The visualizations included
            dynamic elements achieved through the use of filters and parameters. By exploring the data and applying
            different visualizations, I aimed to uncover patterns and relationships that could explain the churn rates.
          </p>

          <h3>Result:</h3>
          <p>Through my analysis in Tableau, I gained valuable insights into the churn rates of Databel. I identified
            key factors that contributed to customer churn and discovered potential strategies to reduce it. The
            visualizations in my dashboard effectively communicated these findings, allowing stakeholders to understand
            the reasons behind churn and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.</p>
