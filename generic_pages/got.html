          <h2>Game of Thrones Deaths Insights</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>Situation:</h3>
        <p>The dashboard created using Tableau provides insights into the deaths in Game of Thrones from Season 1 to
          Season 8. The dashboard includes various visualizations and filters to analyze the deaths effectively.</p>
        <h3>Task:</h3>
        <p>The task was to create a dashboard that showcases the insights about deaths in Game of Thrones, including the
          total death counts, top allegiances, top killers, top killer houses, most methods used to kill, and top
          locations of death.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Action:</h3>
        <p>I utilized Tableau to design a comprehensive dashboard to present the insights on Game of Thrones deaths. I
          incorporated a filter feature that allows users to toggle between different seasons. The dashboard includes a
          KPI card displaying the total death count across all seasons, providing a quick overview of the magnitude of
          deaths.</p>
        <p>For the top allegiances to die, I used visualizations to highlight House Lannister and some unknown
          allegiances as the most affected factions, with death counts of 835 and 432, respectively.</p>
        <p>To identify the top killers, I created a visualization that showed Daenerys Targaryen as the primary culprit,
          with a death count of 1,008. I also included a visualization revealing that House Targaryen was responsible
          for the most deaths among houses, with a count of 1,148.</p>
        <p>In terms of the most common methods used to kill, I presented a visualization indicating that dragonfire
          (Dragon) and swords were the prevalent weapons, accounting for 996 and 322 deaths, respectively. Additionally,
          I included other methods such as knives, arrows, poison, axes, and flaming arrows.</p>
        <p>For the top locations of death, I designed a visualization highlighting King's Landing as the deadliest
          place, with a death count of 1,170. Other notable locations included Winterfell, The Twins, Meereen, and
          beyond the Wall.</p>
        <h3>Result:</h3>
        <p>The final dashboard effectively portrays insights into the deaths in Game of Thrones, enabling users to
          explore the data by season, analyze the total death counts, identify the top allegiances, killers, methods
          used to kill, and locations of death. It provides an easy-to-understand visual representation of the death
          trends throughout the series, enhancing the understanding of this major theme in Game of Thrones.</p>
