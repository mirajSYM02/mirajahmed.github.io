          <strong>Title: Education’s Impact on Employment in Malaysia</strong><br>
          I was assigned to complete this project under the supervision of Professor Azlan bin Mohd Zain, along with the
          guidance of Madam Rozita and Madam Laily, as an intern data analyst and BI developer. I had to present the
          progress weekly in front of the organization’s director as well as the team.

        <br>
        <strong>1. Ask:</strong>
        <br>
        The first and foremost part of conducting any data analysis is to know "What are you trying to answer?" and
        "Why are you trying to answer them?" I received a lot of questions from my supervisor, and some of them are:
        <ul>
          <li>How has education impacted the employability of Malaysia from 2010 until 2019?</li>
          <li>What level of study has higher rates of employability?</li>
          <li>Male or female, which gender leads the number of employments?</li>
          <li>Which types of jobs are more popular among Malaysians?</li>
          <li>Which state has the highest employability rates?</li>
          <li>Being a multi-racial country, which race leads in terms of being employed?</li>
          <li>Do uneducated people remain unemployed?</li>
          <li>Which year has the highest employed and unemployed numbers?</li>
        </ul>
        The answer to these questions will eventually reflect the "what" and "why" of the asking phase.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>2. Prepare:</strong>
        <br>
        Research was conducted with the aim of finding a solution to a problem. In order to address the concerns and
        questions of the stakeholders involved, various sets of data pertaining to employment were gathered and
        analyzed. The chosen tools for this research were Microsoft Excel and PowerBI, as they are the main tools used
        by the organization. To ensure data security and facilitate collaboration, the selected data was stored in
        Google Drive, allowing for backup and easy sharing when needed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3. Process:</strong>
        <br>
        The primary data source utilized in the research was data.gov.my, which is a reliable and trusted data store
        maintained by the government. In order to ensure the quality and reliability of the data, a thorough data
        quality check was conducted. Through this check, any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the data were successfully
        identified and addressed, ensuring that the data used in the research was accurate and reliable.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>4. Analyze:</strong>
        <br>
        To create a comprehensive narrative, the multiple data sets gathered were combined into a single, large dataset.
        This consolidation allowed for a holistic view of the information and facilitated the development of a
        comprehensive story.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>5. Share:</strong>

        <br>
        The combined dataset was then integrated into PowerBI, a powerful data visualization tool.
        Using PowerBI, a dynamic dashboard was created to present the data in an interactive and visually appealing
        manner. The dashboard was designed to address and resolve all the queries and concerns of the stakeholders,
        providing them with a clear and insightful understanding of the data.

        <strong>Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>From 2010 to 2019, the employment statistics were as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Employed: Approximately 13,702,660 people.</li>
              <li>Unemployed: Approximately 8,843,900 people.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Certificate-wise, individuals with a minimum SPM certification had better employment prospects.</li>
          <li>In terms of gender, males dominated with a percentage of 62.35% compared to females.</li>
          <li>Among the major ethnic groups in Malaysia, Bumiputera individuals had a higher success rate in obtaining
            employment compared to other ethnicities.</li>
          <li>Approximately 14.5% of the workforce comprised non-Malaysian individuals.</li>
          <li>The most preferred job sectors for people were service and sales occupations.</li>
        </ol>

        In summary, the employment statistics in Malaysia from 2010 to 2019 showed a significant number of employed
        individuals and a notable gender imbalance with males dominating the workforce. Individuals with a minimum SPM
        certification had better employment prospects, and Bumiputera individuals had a higher success rate in obtaining
        employment. Non-Malaysian individuals constituted a small percentage of the workforce, and service and sales
        occupations were the most preferred job sectors. These insights provide valuable information about the dynamics
        of employment in Malaysia.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Remarks:</strong>

        <br>
        The project was highly successful and received recognition from both my organization and the University of
        Technology Malaysia, who showcased it on their official websites.
        <br>

        <br>
        Working under the guidance of Professor Dr. Azlan Mohd Zain had a profound impact on me, solidifying my interest
        in pursuing data analysis as a future career goal.
