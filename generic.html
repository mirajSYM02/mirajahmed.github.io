        <h2>[1] Accident Notification and Alert System using 3-Axis Accelerometer and GPS Module.</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Abstract</h3>

          Traffic or road accidents are a common occurrence in the modern era. Due to the growing popularity of
          automobiles, road accidents are also increasing on a regular basis. Additionally, an accident's aftershock is
          much worse than the accident itself. In most countries, road accidents are the leading cause of death. As a
          result, numerous automotive manufacturers are taking numerous measures to avoid and provide a safer driving
          experience to their customers. However, these measures are primarily intended to avert an accident, not to
          mitigate its consequences. Not long after emergency assistance arrives, either the patient's condition
          deteriorates or worsens. As a result, an alert and notification system utilizing a flight control GPS module,
          an accelerometer, and an ultrasonic sensor is proposed to alleviate the sufferings. The system will measure
          the tilt angle of the car and compare it to the threshold, triggering the GPS sensor and displaying a
          notification in the Android app with the location.

        <h2>[2] Data Delivery Rate, Comparative Study of HTTP and MQTT Protocols in IoT System</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Abstract</h3>

          The standard and real-time communication technology is an unalloyed inevitability for the development of
          Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is
          challenging for any organization as it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements.
          This paper presented a study and comparison of two widely accepted and evolving messaging protocols, Hypertext
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), for IoT systems. Based on the
          analysis, HTTP received 120 data in 60 seconds, while MQTT-public and local brokers received 2874 data in 60
          seconds. In addition, we compared MQTT data delivery rate on public and local MQTT broker. The results show
          that the MQTT protocol sends more data than the HTTP protocol without experiencing data loss.

        <h2>[3] Final Year Project Thesis</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Abstract</h3>

          The purpose of this project was to develop a mobile application that would notify users of car accidents via
          the internet of things. It sends an alert and notification, complete with location information. The system was
          built around a layered design pattern, and the mobile application was written in dart, primarily using the
          "flutter" framework. The system's flow is as follows: trigger, then pass, and finally fetch. The device serves
          as the trigger and sender, while the mobile application serves as the fetcher. Finally, but certainly not
          least, the medium through which this process occurred was "google firebase." Thus, the proposed notification
          application apps assist in notifying an accident immediately through simple steps, potentially saving the
          lives of numerous people in life-threatening situations.
